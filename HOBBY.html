      My hobby is literally listening to a song. The reason is because by listening to any types of song, I can express my feeling whenever I am in happy or sad mood. When I listening to a happy song, it somehow boost my energy and make my day. I'm listening to a happy song when I am in a good mood. When I had a bad day or in a bad mood, I'm listening to a sad song. I'm listening to a music whenever I want to. For instance, I'm listening to it while completing the assignment, doing chores and when I'm resting. That's all for my hobby part !
